  <h2>Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis</h2>
  <img src="./images/mere.png" alt="Book cover">
  <p>In Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis aims to prove to the sensible skeptic that God 
     does exist and that He sent His son Jesus Christ to redeem the world. 
     The book begins with a logical proof for the Christian God and then transitions 
     into a discussion of the common ground upon which all of those of the Christian faith stand together. 
     Readers at all stages of belief will find that Mere Christianity provides 
     an approachable path to discover a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.

  <h3>5 Key Takeaways</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>There is irrefutable Right and Wrong—referred to as the Law of Nature or Moral Law—that is unique to humanity. 
        We can choose whether or not to obey this Law, and frequently, we do not.
    </li>
    <li>Our conscious may be the best proof that God exists. There must be Something that is directing the universe, 
        and which appears in us as a law urging us to do right and making us feel responsible and uncomfortable when we do wrong.
    </li>
    <li>Christianity is not a simple religion. Much of it is unexpected. And that is all the more reason to suspect that it is true. 
        Reality is tremendously complicated because one must deal with the facts. Anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about.
    </li>
    <li>God gave man free will because, although it makes evil possible, 
        it is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.
    </li>
    <li>The utmost evil is Pride. It was through Pride that the devil became the devil: 
        Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.
    </li>

  <h2>The Screwtape Letters: Letters from a Senior to a Junior Devil  by C. S. Lewis</h2>
  <img src="./images/screwtape.jpg" alt="Book cover">
  <p>A milestone in the history of popular theology, The Screwtape Letters is an iconic classic on spiritual warfare 
    and the power of the devil.</br>This profound and striking narrative takes the form of a series of letters from Screwtape, 
    a devil high in the Infernal Civil Service, to his nephew Wormwood, a junior colleague engaged in his first mission on earth 
    trying to secure the damnation of a young man who has just become a Christian. Although the young man initially looks to be 
    a willing victim, he changes his ways and is "lost" to the young devil.
